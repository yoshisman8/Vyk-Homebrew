These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Panache</h2>\n<p>You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.</p>\n<p>You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.21WIfSu7Xd7uKqV8]{Tumble Through} and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).</p>\n<p>While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.pyo0vmxUFIFX2GNl]{Confident Finisher}, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.</p>\n<p>Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler's Style</h2>\n<p>As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or-death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. The styles presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.5HoEwzLDJGTCZtFa]{Battledancer}</strong> To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions.
