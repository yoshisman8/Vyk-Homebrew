Lives a lesser known, young race of goat-like fey who go by the name of Silufae. Or as they are commonly known, the Goat-Folk.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Around 4511 AR, a group of druids congregated upon a sacred groove within the vast grasslands of the Whistling Plains. There they entreated with the fey and engaged in debauchery for many nights. Songs, dance, drinks, and carnal pleasures of all kinds were had. Though few records really remember how, or why, between the fauns and the druid-- the surrounding goats themselves were transfigured and uplifted into the first Silufae.</p>\n<p>Upon the realization of these newfound creatures instinctual attunement to nature and her spirits, the Druids repeated this ritual for half a decade, giving birth to the first generation of Silufae.</p>\n<p>In spite of the hedonistic nature of their progenitor Faun, the Silufae typically enjoy a more modest and sedentary lifestyle, though they certainly have a penchant for parties and wine. After the first generation grew into adulthood, the Silufae left their parental ancestries and settled in Taldor's Fog Peaks.</p>\n<p>On the edge of the Fog Peaks, within the cliffs of the Whistling Plains, quaint stone houses with mead halls and cozy rugs are nestled on the cliffside and often times covered in morning dew or mountain mist.</p>\n<p>Generations later, around 4632 AR, many Silufae travel around the Taldor's eastern mountain ranges like the World's Edge Mountains, owning a famed teashop in Dragonscar or trading with local dwarves. They are known to be civil and helpful as well as prolific gatherers. Though unpopular to most conservatives within Taldor, the faeborn race were given the rights to their ancestral homelands and recently made into Taldane citizens in 4718 AR. This is in large part thanks to Queen Eutropia Stavian when she learned of their existence while assessing the threat of undead rising up within The Valley of the Azlanti.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Silufae are governed by the elder Volkien Kaprin who is a 180 years old cleric of Erastil. Though relunctact, Archdruid Kaprin did accept Eutropia's \"bargain\" to exchange their famed tea to the royal family in exchange for Taldane citizenship.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Always be on the lookout for ingredients to create new tea recipes.</li>\n<li>Be an avid drinker and party goer.</li>\n<li>Journeying the world in search of more ways to make societies be harmonious with nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognize your Satyr and Faun origins</li>\n<li>View such Fey origins as a sign that they shouldn't trust you.</li>\n<li>Expect you to be an expert in all things debauchery, wine, and tea.</li>\n<li>Reject your status as a Taldane citizen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Silufae are easily identifiable as humanoid creatures resembling goats. Their bodies covered in fur with colors and patterns one would expect of such animal. Some Silufae have hair on their head similar to other humanoids, often with a different shade of color as their natural fur. A common trait on all silufae regardless of sex, all silufae possess hooved feet, a short bushy tail and a set of horns on their heads which are often rammed against the heads of siblings, friends and rivals.</p>\n<p>Because of their Fey nature, Silufae grow slowly and have longer livespans. A healthy Silufae can live for upwards of 200 years before succumbing to old age. However most Silufae average at around 100 or 120 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Being such a young and fledgling race, Silufae society has been mostly dictated by the edicts of the god they choose to ask for guidance in their eary days, Erastil. Silufae venere the guidance of elders, and value the tried and true traditions they have fostered over the years.</p>\n<p>Silufae villages are often led by their eldest member, a title passed down once the eldest becomes too frail to lead. Being mountain twellers, Silufae often organize hunts against Rocs as coming of age rituals, have ceremoial tea parties to celebrate birthdays, aniversaries and milestones of their young. And have a tight sense of community.</p>\n<h2>Relations</h2>\n<p>After their integration into Taldor by Queen Eutropia into Taldane society, the Silufae began to interact at greater length with other races. However even before then they had an ally in the form of Dwarves of World's Edge Mountains.</p>\n<p>Following the edicts of Erastil, Silufae strive to have good relations with all beings they come across. It's not uncommon for traveling Silufae to openly wear symbols of Erastil to help ease interactions with strangers.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Silufae seldom astray from the path of law and good, as most Silufae settlements openly and actively worship Erastil. While some individuals would feel more inclined to the chaotic and free-spirited roots of their ancestral feyblood, few are rarer than Silufae who are led to the side of Evil. These individuals are often cast out of villages and left to fend for themselves in the harsh world outside.</p>\n<p>While Erastil is the deity Silufae often pray to, it is not uncommon for Silufae who have grown up outside of villages to worship the deities of those they spend the most time with, such as Dwarven gods for the silufae living in World's Edge Mountains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["fey","humanoid","hb_silufae"],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.744,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-05T09:35:46.582-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.268","system":"3.9.2"}}},"hp":6,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["str"]},"1":{"value":["cha","int","wis"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["int","wis"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","sylvan"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"iu53l":{"pack":"vyk-homebrew.silufae-ancestry","id":"eTfvODNVItQu8wfu","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/terrain-rocks-brown.webp","name":"Mountaneering","level":1},"32ckn":{"pack":"vyk-homebrew.silufae-ancestry","id":"4wrUfVXn23vNEq9j","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/goat-horned-blue.webp","name":"Ramming Horns","level":1}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"KPVkkpR21c13yy2y":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.9AThmqK0k6PprZQT"}}}
